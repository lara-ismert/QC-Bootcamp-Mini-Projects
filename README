Let $N$ be an integer larger than 2, and let $n$ be the bit length of $N$.
In this repository, I seek to implement the order-finding oracle in 
Shor's algorithm, which is comprised of multiple controlled-U gates, 
where each U implements multiplication mod N on the computational basis
vectors with labeling from $Z_{2^n}$.

Our first implementation comes from Beauregard's article 
*Circuit for Shorâ€™s algorithm using 2n+3 qubits*.
